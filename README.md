# CPE-357-Systems-Programming

CPE-357 is known, for good reason, as the hardest class that all Cal Poly CS majors must pass. It mainly conists of working through a seemingly-endless supply of Lab Projects and and smaller coding assignments focused on all aspects of C coding. Unfortionately, due to restrictions imposed by the proffessor, I cannot post assignments and projects publicly. If you are interested in seeing my work from this class, please contact me directly.
